	"default": "Hi, and welcome to BombCorp, new employee! You have one job here, and that's to uh, dodge bombs thrown at your mouse cursor. Eyup. That's it. Sound's simple enough, doesn't it? Well, i'll give you the run-down.\n\nNormal 'black' bombs follow your mouse cursor. Hit them with your cursor, and they explode! They dissapear after 5 seconds.\n\nGrey bombs are faster than normal bombs, although, they dissapear after 3 seconds. They also explode.\n\nSkull bombs are an instant game-over.\n\nHover over any of the any buttons for some mode-specific info.",
	"classic": "**BEGINNER**\nGood ol' classic mode. This mode only features the normal 'black' bomb.",
	"survival": "**INTERMEDIATE**\nTest your might!\n\nSee how long you can survive! This mode follows the same rules as classic, however, now with the inclusion of the 'grey' speedy bombs and the red 'insta-kill' bombs.",
	"hardcore": "**HARD**\nFew have dared to try this mode...\n\nAll bombs are an insta-kill. They also spawn and move at a much faster rate.\n\nOnly true masters of this game will succeed!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGood Luck!",
